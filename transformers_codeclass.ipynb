    "- neural networks: what if instead of using just one logistic regression, we chained a bunch of them together in multiple layers? Turns out that gives us a really flexible model for working with super high dimensional data types like text or images. [(3Blue1Brown has a great series on YouTube if you want to actually understand how neural nets work in any detail.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk)\n",
    "- model architecture: the configuration of units and connections that define a specific neural network (i.e. the overall shape of the model).\n",
    "- model checkpoint: the parameters (weights and biases) that the model learns through training. (i.e. the trained model)\n",
    "- transfer learning: taking a model checkpoint trained on one task or dataset and using it for another task or dataset (either as-is, or modified to adapt it to that task).\n",
    "- language modeling: statistically modeling how words in natural language relate to each other, often for next-word or missing-word prediction (like predictive keyboards on smartphones). It turns out that language models are good to use for transfer learning, because the things they learn about the underlying interdependencies of language are widely useful for a variety of NLP tasks. \n",

    "A *Transformer* is a kind of neural network architecture designed for language modeling, first introduced by researchers at Google in 2017 [(Vaswani et al. 2017)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf). The big innovation of the transformer architecture is that it is much more computationally efficient than the other types of neural network architectures used for language modeling up to that point (mostly RNNs and LSTMs). The efficiency of the architecture meant that researchers could train much larger models on much larger quantities of data. Another research team at Google followed up the original Transformer paper by releasing a model called BERT, and open-sourcing the model checkpoints for other researchers to use [(Devlin et al. 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf&usg=ALkJrhhzxlCL6yTht2BRmH9atgvKFxHsxQ). The BERT model has 336M trainable parameters and recognizes a vocabulary of over 30,000 English terms. It was trained on two massive text corpora, the WikiText-103 corpus (which is basically all of wikipedia) and the BookCorpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "The publication of BERT launched a new era in NLP research, as these huge language models facilitated much more effective transfer learning than anything that had come before. Most tasks in NLP can be improved through the use of BERT or another transformer model like it.\n",

    "## 3. What is ðŸ¤—?\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ¤— (Hugging Face) exists in the form that it does today as a result of competition between the two most common deep learning frameworks for Python, `PyTorch` and `TensorFlow`. Researchers at Google first introduced the Transformer architecture [(Vaswani et al. 2017)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) and also developed BERT, one of the early general-purpose Transformer language models [(Devlin et al. 2018)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf&usg=ALkJrhhzxlCL6yTht2BRmH9atgvKFxHsxQ). Google also owns TensorFlow, so when the BERT paper was published in 2018, the research team open sourced the pre-trained models as TensorFlow objects (which are all still available on their [GitHub](https://github.com/google-research/bert), BTW). The developers at Hugging Face wanted to use BERT models in their research, but primarily worked in PyTorch, so they converted the models and released a python package called `pytorch-pretrained-bert` that was simply a set of commands for downloading the converted BERT models as PyTorch objects. This quickly became hugely popular, and the de-facto default implementation for other researchers who wanted to use BERT models with PyTorch (which was a lot of people). As more pre-trained transformers were published, Hugging Face started hosting those as well, and began developing a general set of tools to work with these models. Around this time they also changed the name of their python package to the more general `transformers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, Hugging Face maintains several python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `transformers` provides functions for downloading and implementing Transformer models for NLP tasks. All the tools now work in both PyTorch and TensorFlow, and many models are now available for both frameworks as well. \n",
    "- `huggingface_hub` integrates with the online repository of models that Hugging Face hosts ([huggingface.co/models](https://huggingface.co/models)) and allows users to upload their own fine-tuned transformers. There are currently 17,196 model checkpoints hosted on the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
    "- `datasets` provides easy access to an online library of major public datasets for NLP, and also provides an efficient data format for use with `transformers` functions and models."
